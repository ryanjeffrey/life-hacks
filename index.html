            <p>Life is hard, even for people who make it look easy. Every day there is a new challenge to face, fire to put out, or problem to solve. The key to feeling centered is to cultivate as many good habits as possible. Your habits determine the quality of your life. Here is a list of things that I completely sucked at when I was in my twenties. If I can grow in these ways, so can you.</p>

                <p id="article-copy">This is a tough one because many people are so afraid of death that they avoid even thinking about it. As harsh as it sounds- you will die, everyone in your family will die, and everyone else who will ever live will also die. Maybe I’m being macabre, but it’s true. <br><br>

                The cool thing is that instead of being sad about it, you can let it motivate you to treat people with respect and love. Knowing that you will lose someone makes your time with them more precious. You never know when it will be the last time you see someone, so always communicate what you need to them and tell people you love that you love them! That way, when the end comes (and it comes for us all), there are no regrets.
